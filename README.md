# LandKit
Landkit’s landing page examples can be used out of the box, but since they’re built on flexible components, you can also create new pages all your own with ease. Copy-paste a section here, a component there, switch up a few variables, and you have an entirely new landing!
#Here are the examples we provide to give you an idea of what’s possible:
Web Service
Cloud Hosting
Rental
Job Listing
Coworking
Agency
Startup [New]
Landkit also has a collection of supporting pages to build a complete site:

Development Highlights
We built Landkit with the same ethos as Bootstrap itself, meaning customizing and extending our components should be as simple as working with Bootstrap’s core.

##Component-centric SCSS
Customization made easy with extensive use of SASS variables
Live reload and webpack for rapid development and compilation
Fully responsive on all modern browsers
Rich documentation with code samples and parameters/options
SVGs for rich dividers/backgrounds controlled by SCSS variables
 

##Design Highlights
Landkit’s was designed as a rich system from the start, which is reflected in both the end result and the original design.

#Beautiful, modern style flexible enough to suit most brands
Included Figma design file
Type styles, color styles, and components for easy file-wide changes
All images are included with a free-to-use license
Two included icon sets – one rich duotone set and one simpler set for utility
Included HK Grotesk Pro (premium font) with license for free extended use (Generously provided by the incredibly talented Alfredo Marco Pradil)
 

##Interaction Highlights
We use modern libraries under active development and focus on making it incredibly easy to attach behavior to elements by using “data-attributes”.

#Megamenu Navigation: Native Bootstrap markup to create rich card-like dropdowns
Animate Elements: Rich, performant animations fired when an element is on screen
Parallax: GPU-accelerated scrolling parallax on backgrounds and DOM elements
Sliders: Beautiful slider options for testimonials, logos, inline galleries
Photo/Video Zoom: Beautiful image and video zoom that feel like elements are being lifted off the page
Typed Text: Automated type-and-delete text
Animated Counting: Animated count up/down to any number
Stylable Maps: Mapbox integration allows for customizable, beautiful maps
Smooth Scroll: Easily link to other parts of the page with a slick scroll
 

##Free updates and support
No matter how well documented and built something is, sometimes you just need a little help! That’s why we make ourselves available to help you anytime, just contact our support (support contact info delivered with the theme at the time of purchase). We’re also planning tons of updates! In addition to keeping Landkit up to date with Bootstrap’s core and any necessary patches, we’ll be adding new features regularly over the coming months!
